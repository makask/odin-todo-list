# odin-todo-list

This "todo" list is one of the tasks required by the odin project. Todo lists are a staple in beginning 
webdev tutorials because they can be very simple. There is, however, a lot of room for improvement and 
many features that can be added. ‘Todos’ are objects that are dynamically created, which 
means either using factories or constructors/classes to generate them. This project is created using 
a webpack. For storing the tasks this project uses Web Storage API.
